			<h2>Career Summary</h2>

			<h3>Virtuous Truffle Company: Sole Owner {July 2019 - Present}</h3>

				<p>
					I care for the production of high quality luxury goods. This premium confectionery company is my way of presenting my love for indulgence, extravagance and high quality production methods. It has allowed me to showcase and develop my skills in business management methods such as stock management, financial record keeping, operations management, marketing and graphic design. I have utilised some of my favourite software in this context, including Microsoft Excel, Adobe Photoshop, Serif PagePlus and Autodesk Inventor, while maintaining related features on my <a href="https://www.virtuoustrufflecompany.co.uk">website</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vtctruffles">Instagram</a> account. 
				</p>

			<h3>Lakeland PLC: Retail Assistant {August 2019 - January 2020}</h3>	

				<p>
					It started as completing morning deliveries like Jeff Bezos on day one, to selling a record number of products like The Wolf while on front of house demonstrations – 400% more than the runner-up on my best performing day. Lakeland offered me development from all angles, social and economic. I’ve received multiple cases of praise regarding my “impeccable” customer service and understanding of social desires. I was trusted to open and close store, manage the store funds and stock and have perpetual input in the store marketing and sales. I provided a strong, kind and reliable face by adopting a customer-centric nature. My excellent relationship with my boss allowed transparency and freedom which translated to efficiency and a strong understanding of operations. Lakeland is a place of strong hierarchical and consumer intimacy and thus, provided me with great joy.  
				</p>

			<h3>J Sainsbury PLC: Customer Assistant {July 2018 - October 2018}</h3>

				<p>
					Sainsburys housed my first real 'student' retail job. As expected, I was responsible for the standard mediocre operations such as till and cash management, stock replenishment and management, handling of lottery, liquor and tobacco, and general store maintenance. The Sainsburys 'Think 25' protocol introduced me to analysing and identifying human age at a rapid pace while serving certain customers. The geographical position of the store I worked in presented frequent 'challenges' (not really, for anyone with half a brain) such as attempted violence and very minor robberies. This was a fun experience and kept daily operations interesting.   
				</p>

			<h3>Sedgwick PLC: Customer Service Agent {June 2018 - July 2018}</h3>

				<p>
					I managed traffic from policyholders, clients and adjusters within the communication wing of their Glasgow office. I implemented a complex database directory with simultaneous tasks in ambition to connect and satisfy policyholders, clients and my employer. I balanced care for the client and policyholder through composure and vigilance regarding provoked policyholders, diffusing confrontation. I left this summer position after a month due to a hostile workplace. And not the Wall Street kind of hostile that I like. This was more 'workplace crumbling', less 'tear your head off'.

			<h2>Income Streams</h2>

				<p>
					As we all know from the 10X Rule, and general common sense, passive income and constant cash flow/replenishment makes more sense than relying on the uncertainty of small month-to-month paychecks. Diversification is key, as anyone with half a brain realises. I have listed below all of the methods I personally use/have previously used to build 'wealth'. Note that I am certainly no millionaire however, standard millionaire/billionaire practice can be easily applied to smaller, more socially standard household wealth - in the thousand, ten-thousand and hundred-thousand ranges. I've also included brief notes on my personal cash management.   
				</p>

			<h3>Passive Income</h3>

				<p class="small">
				<b>1) Stock, Commodity & Cryptocurrency Portfolio: </b>A well diversified folio can lead to a consistent/growing frequent cash in-flow
				<br>
				<b>2) Bond & Low-Risk Asset Portfolio: </b>Bonds and assets alike can be as low as £5k and provide comfortable cash flow supplement at maturity
				<br>
				<b>3) ISA & Savings Accounts: </b>Small reward but a good place to keep £10k+ sums of cash which aren't enough to invest in larger opportunities 
				</p>

			<h3>Human Labour Income</h3>

				<p class="small">
				<b>4) Self-Employment: </b>Offering higher-risk, higher-return as the growth and stability of this cash flow vein is in your hands
				<br>
				<b>5) Other Employment: </b>As referenced above, as a student, this income method provides a small but stable cash replenishment stream 
				<br>
				<b>6) Freelancing Talents: </b>Freelancing small talents such as graphic design, financial management, manual labour etc. makes a good supplement 
				</p>

			<h3>Cash Flow Management</h3>
				
				<p class="small">
				<b>A) Cash In/Out Current: </b>Receive all personal payments and make all low-medium cash purchases. Also a hub for managing cash distribution
				<br>
				<b>B) Large Cash In/Out Current: </b>Not holding as much as savings accounts etc. but used for larger transactions
				<br>
				<b>C) Everyday Spending Current: </b>Used to receive budgets from myself for very small daily purchases such as train tickets, beer etc.
				<br>
				<b>D) Business Account: </b>Used to receive personally owned business cash inflows and for business expenses - utilising business benefits
				<br>
				<b>E) Credit Account: </b>Used for any purchase of my choice, usually larger purchases to gain the benefits of the account (and credit score)
